# HTML to Markdown Parser

* An app that reads an RSS feed, gets a list of links from the feed and scrapes the HTML of the links in to Markdown format
* Saves all the Markdown in to date stamped folders
* Saves all images from within the main content of the blog in to the same folder as the Markdown
* Has some Unit Tests and uses Serilog for logging
